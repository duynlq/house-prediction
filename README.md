## Problem Statement
- What determines the value of a house? Square footage should be the first topic of discussion for the price of a house, then sequentially the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc. In ecommerce, these factors are the first things that potential homeowners or renters are first exposed to. Land value can also be a significant factor for the price of a house. 
- Consequently, we need to determine if the sales price (and its relationship to square footage) depends on which neighborhood that the house is located in.
- Additionally, through feature selection and observation elimination techniques, a satisfactory linear regression model can be created using the housing features amongst the 80 given in this dataset.

## Statistical Analysis Summary
- Both 'SalesPrice' and 'GrLivArea' (greater living area) show evidence of a linear relationship, however there are outliers that are affecting their linearity.
- Through logarithmic transformation,
