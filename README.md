## Problem Statement
- What determines the value of a house? Square footage should be the first topic when discussing the price of a house, then sequentially the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc. In ecommerce, these factors are the first things that potential homeowners or renters are first exposed to. Land value can also be a significant factor for the price of a house. 
- Consequently, we need to determine if the sales price and its relationship to square footage depends on which neighborhood that the house is located in.
